PHP CRUD operation task which was assigned by my supervisor. A program to create,read, update, delete contents from a table including Image. An important feature was - 
1.    Fetch an old image from the database with row id. 
2.    Remove the image from the database when someone wants to update the new image on the button click 
3.    Move the new image to the same folder.
